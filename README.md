Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Carolina.

A developer (and illustrator ðŸŽ¨) from Argentina. 

Iâ€™v finished a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp with Node.js and now I'm deepening my knowledge of React, but I also love all kind of WebGL and inmersive experiences.   
I'm progressing towards completing a Bachelor of IT.


My interests include animation, design, game development and reading âœ¨.

I'm open to work!
